"""Postgres checkpointer wiring for the estimation graph (Level 2).

The graph persists its state per ``thread_id`` in the SAME project Postgres that
holds the pgvector embeddings — the checkpointer creates its own tables
(``checkpoints``, ``checkpoint_writes``, ``checkpoint_blobs``) and coexists with
them. No new infrastructure.

LangGraph's ``AsyncPostgresSaver`` is built on **psycopg3 (async)**, so it wants a
plain libpq DSN (``postgresql://user:pass@host/db``) — NOT the SQLAlchemy
``postgresql+psycopg://`` / ``+asyncpg`` forms. ``saver_conninfo`` derives it from
the single ``DATABASE_URL`` by stripping the driver token, mirroring
``_async_database_url`` in ``app/foundation/persistence/database.py`` (which swaps
the token for the SQLAlchemy async engine instead).

Live-session change (Session 13): the flow now PAUSES at two human gates and may sit
idle for minutes or days before a resume. A single long-lived connection (the
pre-exercise ``from_conn_string``) can be dropped by the server or a NAT during that
idle, so a resume would hit a dead socket. We back the saver with an
``AsyncConnectionPool`` instead: it validates/reconnects connections on checkout, so
a days-later resume gets a live connection. The saver needs each connection in
``autocommit`` mode with server-side prepares off and a dict row factory — the same
kwargs ``from_conn_string`` set, passed here through the pool.
