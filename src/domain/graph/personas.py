"""Matrix-themed personas for the graph agents (Session 13 live, didactic).

Each agent in the flow is "played" by a Matrix character. The persona is a SHORT
framing string prepended/appended to the agent's existing system prompt — it never
replaces the task instructions, and every persona ends with a guardrail line so the
in-character voice can't cost accuracy or break the required output shape (the Pydantic
``response_model`` still binds it).

Toggled globally by ``GRAPH_PERSONAS_ENABLED`` (see ``app/config.py``). The Rails side
carries the matching visual identity (name/avatar/tagline) in
``estimator-web/app/models/agents/graph_flow.rb`` — keep the character mapping in sync.

Keys are the graph node function names (same seam the nodes call with).
