"""The graph's shared, typed state (Level 1 → the live multi-agent flow).

A LangGraph ``StateGraph`` threads ONE state object through every node; each node
returns a *partial* update and LangGraph merges it in. For most fields the merge is
last-writer-wins (the update replaces the value). For a field annotated with a
**reducer** the merge is delegated to that reducer instead, so a node can return
only the *new* items and LangGraph combines them with what prior nodes accumulated.

Three accumulator fields use that pattern:

* ``budget_matches`` — legacy component-level matches (``operator.add`` concat).
* ``errors`` — any node appends a soft failure without clobbering earlier ones.
* ``task_hours`` — the per-task hours FAN-OUT accumulator. This is the one the live
  session cares about: ``estimate_task_hours`` runs once per approved task in
  PARALLEL (Send API) and each branch returns a one-element list. A plain
  ``operator.add`` would append duplicates if a resume re-entered the fan-out, so it
  uses the KEYED reducer ``merge_task_hours`` (dedupe by ``(module, task)``,
  last-write-wins) — idempotent across resumes.

The state now carries the whole multi-agent flow, not just the final estimate:
``complexity`` + ``reformulated_transcript`` (classifier), ``structure`` +
``approved_modules`` (structure_agent + human gate 1), ``task_hours`` + ``estimate``
(hours agent), ``analysis_report`` (analysis_agent), ``gate*_decision`` (the human
resume payloads, kept for audit) and ``proposal`` (proposal_agent, bonus).
