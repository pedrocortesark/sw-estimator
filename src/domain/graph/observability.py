"""Logfire observability for the graph (Level 2).

``configure_logfire`` wires Pydantic Logfire once at startup:

* per-node ``logfire.span("node: …")`` calls in ``nodes.py`` become one span per
  node inside the request trace;
* ``instrument_fastapi`` gives the HTTP request its root span;
* ``instrument_httpx`` captures the outbound OpenAI / embedding calls the nodes make
  (the OpenAI SDK uses httpx under the hood), so LLM latency shows up in the trace.

It is a **no-op without a token**: ``send_to_logfire="if-token-present"`` means a
run with no ``LOGFIRE_TOKEN`` still executes every span locally but exports nothing,
so the service never depends on Logfire being configured. Set ``LOGFIRE_TOKEN`` (and
optionally ``LOGFIRE_SEND_TO_LOGFIRE=1``) to get the trace link for the deliverable.

If you prefer LangSmith, this is the seam to swap: leave the ``logfire.span`` calls
(they are cheap no-ops) and configure the LangGraph tracer here instead.
