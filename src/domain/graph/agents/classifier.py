"""``classifier_agent`` — the flow's entry agent (complexity + reformulation).

Reads the raw meeting transcript and does two jobs in one structured call: it judges
how COMPLEX the estimation will be (mapped later to the structure agent's reasoning
effort) and REFORMULATES the transcript into a clean, self-contained project brief.

It then performs an explicit HANDOVER to ``structure_agent`` via ``Command(goto=...,
update=...)`` — passing both control and the state it produced. That is the first of
the two agent-to-agent handovers the live session highlights.
