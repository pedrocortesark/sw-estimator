"""Post-generation checks for grounded estimates (Session 9).

Two independent guards run after the LLM returns an :class:`Estimate`:

* :func:`validate_citations` — every cited ``source_id`` must correspond to a
  chunk that was actually retrieved. Fabricated ids are the classic grounding
  failure and trigger one corrective retry in the orchestrator.
* :func:`check_coherence` — the ``insufficient`` confidence level has a strict
  shape (no numbers, an explanation present); a violation is a malformed
  response, not a valid estimate.
