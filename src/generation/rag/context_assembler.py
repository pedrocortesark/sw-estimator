"""Augmentation: assemble retrieved chunks into a delimited context block.

Two anti-patterns this module exists to avoid:

* ``"\\n\\n".join(chunk.content for chunk in chunks)`` — the model cannot tell
  where one source ends and the next begins, nor which id to cite. Each chunk is
  wrapped in an ``<source>`` element carrying its id and metadata so the
  generator can ground every claim in a specific, citable source.
* Splitting a chunk mid-way when the context overflows. :func:`truncate_to_token_budget`
  drops whole chunks from the tail (least relevant first) — a half budget line
  item is worse than one fewer budget line item.
