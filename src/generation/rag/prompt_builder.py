"""Prompt construction for grounded estimate generation (Session 9 + 11).

The system prompt encodes the grounding policy: every task must cite the
specific chunk_id(s) it derives from, include verbatim evidence from the source,
and set grounded=False when no source supports the task. Fabricated ids are
forbidden, and when the context cannot support an estimate the model must say
so via ``confidence="insufficient"`` rather than guess.

        "objects. Each SourceCitation must include:\n"
        "   - `chunk_id`: the `id` attribute of the <source> element you are citing\n"
        "   - `document_id`: the `budget_id` attribute of the same <source> element\n"

        "   - `used_for`: a brief description of what this source contributed\n"

        "task with verbatim evidence. Set `grounded=false` when no source supports "
        "the task (leave `sources` empty in that case).\n"
        "4. NEVER invent chunk_ids. If you cannot find a source that directly supports "
        "a task, set `grounded=false` and move that scope to the `assumptions` array "
        "instead of fabricating a citation.\n"
        "5. total_engineer_days must equal the sum of all tasks across all modules.\n"
        "6. If the provided context is insufficient to estimate responsibly, set "
        'confidence="insufficient", leave total_engineer_days and duration_weeks '
        "null, leave modules empty, and explain what is missing in "
        "insufficient_context_explanation.\n"
