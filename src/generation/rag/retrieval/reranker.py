"""Cross-encoder reranker wrapper (Session 10).

Bi-encoders (the embedding retriever) encode the query and each document
SEPARATELY, so "relevance" is just the cosine of two vectors computed without
either side ever seeing the other — fast, but it misses fine-grained relevance.
A cross-encoder feeds the ``(query, document)`` pair through the model TOGETHER
and outputs a single relevance score, attending across both texts. Far more
accurate, far too slow to run over the whole corpus — hence recall-then-rerank:
the bi-encoder/lexical branches recall a wide candidate set cheaply, the
cross-encoder rescores just those.

This module is the wrapper (model loading + pair scoring). It does NOT decide the
recall width or the final cut — that orchestration lives in ``pipeline.retrieve``.

The model is multilingual (``cross-encoder/mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12-H384-v1``) so it
copes with the corpus regardless of the Spanish/English question, and it is small
enough to run on CPU at teaching latencies. It loads LAZILY on first use: importing
this module must stay cheap (tests, app startup) and must not require torch weights
on disk until something actually reranks.
