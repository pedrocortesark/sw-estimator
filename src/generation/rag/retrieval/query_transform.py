"""Query expansion and decomposition (Session 10, Article 4).

Two DISTINCT techniques that are not interchangeable; the distinguishing question
is *one thing said many ways, or many things said at once?*

* **Expansion (multi-query)** — N reformulations of the SAME intent. Fights the
  formulation lottery (the query's vocabulary deciding what is retrieved). Fused
  by consensus (RRF): a chunk many variants agree on rises.
* **Decomposition** — independent sub-queries, one per TOPIC. Fights the averaged
  embedding of a multi-topic query ("near everything, near nothing"). Fused by
  coverage (round-robin): every topic gets representation.

Which one (if any) to apply is a cheap heuristic on the query's length/structure;
the decision is logged. The LLM call uses structured output (``LLMWrapper`` +
Pydantic) on a small, fast model, with "short-leash" instructions: keep exact
domain terms, do not invent requirements, fewer is better than fragmented, and at
most 4 sub-queries (the cap lives in the schema AND the instructions).
