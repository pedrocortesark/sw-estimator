"""Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) — combine independent rankings into one.

RRF fuses rankings by POSITION, not by score, which is exactly what we want when
the two branches produce incomparable scores: cosine distance (lower = better)
from the vector branch and ``ts_rank_cd`` (higher = better) from the lexical one.
Normalising those onto a shared scale is fiddly and corpus-dependent; RRF sidesteps
it by only trusting the order each branch puts things in.

The score of a document is ``sum(1 / (k + rank))`` over every ranking it appears
in (rank is 0-based here). The smoothing constant ``k`` damps the contribution of
top positions: a large ``k`` flattens the curve so a document must rank well in
*both* branches to win, while a small ``k`` lets a single #1 dominate. 60 is the
value from the original Cormack et al. paper and a sane default.

Pure and synchronous on purpose — trivially unit-testable, no I/O.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rankings:
        One list of chunk ids per branch, each already ordered best→worst. A
        branch that returned nothing contributes an empty list (it just adds no
        score). Duplicate ids within a single ranking are ignored after their
        first (best) occurrence.
    k:
        RRF smoothing constant (see module docstring). Must be positive.

    -------
    list[tuple[int, float]]
        ``(chunk_id, fused_score)`` sorted by score descending. Ties break by
        ascending id so the output is deterministic.
