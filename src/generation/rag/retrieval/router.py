"""Multi-index routing in a cascade of increasing cost (Session 10, Article 5).

The corpus is heterogeneous, so searching every collection on every query lets
the dominant type flood the top-k. The router decides WHICH collections to search,
resolving in order — the cheapest signal that suffices wins:

0. **Explicit** — the caller named the collections in the request contract. The
   best router is no router: if the client knows, we trust it and classify nothing.
1. **Rules** — deterministic vocabulary patterns (``collections.match_rules``). A
   query saying "budget"/"cost"/"hours" obviously wants budgets; no LLM needed.
2. **Classifier** — an LLM with structured output emits 1–3 targets plus a
   one-sentence reason. Ambiguity is modelled as MULTIPLE targets, never a
   confidence threshold.
3. **Fallback** — search every collection in parallel. Graceful degradation:
   never worse than the single-index world we came from.

Every decision is logged with its level and reason (attribute, audit, debug).
This is a deliberately bounded precursor to agentic handover: a closed
classification, no open-ended reasoning, no tools.
