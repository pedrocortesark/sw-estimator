"""Temporal decay: down-weight stale finalists (Session 10, Article 6).

An embedding encodes what a chunk SAYS, not when it was written or whether it is
still true — the 2019 AngularJS budget can be semantically perfect and
operationally dangerous. Temporal decay is the SOFT counterpart to a hard date
filter: instead of excluding old chunks, it multiplies their relevance by an
exponential decay so recency breaks ties without silencing history.

``weight = 0.5 ** (age_days / half_life_days)`` — a chunk exactly one half-life
old keeps half its score; the default half-life is generous (≈900 days ≈ 2.5y)
because budgets age slowly. It is applied LAST, on the finalists, AFTER reranking
("lo blando, al cierre"): the expensive cross-encoder decides relevance, then
decay only adjusts the final order. Never before reranking, or recency would
distort the candidate set the reranker sees.

Precondition: the base score must be NON-NEGATIVE (decay is a 0..1 multiplier, so
a negative base would move *up* toward zero and invert the order). The caller is
responsible for that — the advanced pipeline maps reranker logits through a
sigmoid before calling here.

Pure and synchronous — trivially unit-testable, no I/O. The reference date is
injected by the caller (so tests are deterministic and the module stays free of
wall-clock calls).
