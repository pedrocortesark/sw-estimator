"""Session 11 — semantic hallucination gate over a grounded estimate.

``verify_citations`` (Session 11 pre-work) proves REFERENTIAL integrity: every
cited ``chunk_id`` was actually retrieved. That is necessary but not sufficient —
a line can cite a real ``<source>`` and still invent the number: the citation is
real, the figure is hallucinated. This module adds the SEMANTIC layer on top:

* :func:`numeric_anchor` — a DETERMINISTIC anchor: the historical hours the cited
  chunks carry (metadata ``estimated_hours`` or a figure parsed from the source
  text), converted to engineer-days. No LLM, no cost, no variance.
* :func:`judge_estimate` — a STRICT judge (one batched LLM call): for each
  grounded line, does the cited evidence actually support the claimed number and
  scope? Reuses :class:`LLMWrapper` (Instructor), never the raw Responses API.
* :func:`gate_line` — the GRADED gate: a pure combiner of the anchor and the
  verdict into ``grounded`` / ``degraded`` / ``insufficient``.
* :func:`gate_estimate` — the conductor: anchors every line, runs the judge once
  (unless ``use_judge=False``) and aggregates a :class:`HallucinationReport`.

The rule is deliberately asymmetric and teachable: a grounded line may estimate
LESS than its source (it is one slice of a historical component), but a line that
claims substantially MORE than the evidence it cites — or that the judge cannot
tie to that evidence — is a hallucination wearing a real citation, and is graded
``degraded``.
