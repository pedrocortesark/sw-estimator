"""Session 11 — two-stage synthesis of the per-task hours.

The per-task hours estimator (:mod:`app.generation.rag.task_hours`) averages the
nearest historical tasks into one weighted-consensus number. That is right when
the neighbours agree — and misleading when they do not: if one analog says 40h
and another 90h, the 65h midpoint reads as a confident point estimate while
hiding a 2× disagreement. Synthesis makes the disagreement first-class:

* Stage 1 — DETERMINISTIC anchor: the weighted consensus already computed by
  ``task_hours._consensus`` (reused, not re-implemented) plus its dispersion.
* Stage 2 — JUDGEMENT: only when the dispersion crosses the contradiction
  threshold, emit an hour :class:`HourRange` (low..high) with a reason naming the
  conflict. An optional cheap LLM phrases the reason; a deterministic fallback
  (min/max of the neighbours + a templated reason) runs when the LLM is disabled
  or unavailable, so the range is always produced offline.

The point ``estimated_hours`` is left untouched (the human still edits one
number); the range travels alongside it as the honest-uncertainty signal.
