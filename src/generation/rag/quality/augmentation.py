"""Session 11 — context augmentation: shape the retrieved chunks before assembly.

Two deterministic passes applied to the token-truncated chunks BEFORE they become
the ``<source>`` block (:mod:`app.generation.rag.context_assembler`), each
independently switchable so it can be measured in isolation:

* :func:`extract_key_points` / :func:`compress_chunk` — extractive compression:
  keep the lines that carry a figure or an id (the component name + hours the
  generator must ground on), drop the filler, so the token budget buys more
  distinct sources.
* :func:`reorder_edge_loaded` — a countermeasure to *lost-in-the-middle*: put the
  strongest sources at both ends of the context and bury the weakest in the middle.

Pure functions, no LLM, no cost. Ids are preserved, so downstream citation
verification is unaffected.
