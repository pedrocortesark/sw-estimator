"""Boss orchestrator — coordinates Actor and Critic.

The Boss is a tiny state machine:

    actor_call → critic_review → decide
                                  ├── accept      → return
                                  ├── needs_iteration AND iterations_left
                                  │                  → re-call actor with feedback
                                  │                  → loop
                                  └── (out of iterations or reject)
                                                   → synthesize fallback

The Boss does NOT do LLM calls of its own — it only chooses what to do next.
That keeps the decision logic provable: every choice is traceable in
``BossTrace.iterations`` and reproducible from the inputs.

The Actor is passed as a callable rather than an object. The signature is::

    actor(critic_feedback: CriticFeedback | None) -> EstimationResult

so the Boss can re-invoke the actor at iteration N+1 with the feedback from
iteration N. Wiring lives in ``EstimationService.estimate_with_acb``.
