"""Failure mode #2 — an accumulator channel with no reducer loses writes.

SYMPTOM (live): two agents run in the same superstep (a fan-out) and both append to the
audit trail. Without a reducer, LangGraph refuses the concurrent write with
``InvalidUpdateError: Can receive only one value per step`` — or, in a sequential re-entry
(a resumed interrupt), the second write silently REPLACES the first and a row vanishes
from the trail.

CAUSE: the channel was declared as a plain ``list``. A LangGraph channel with no reducer
is last-write-wins; an accumulator MUST declare how two writes combine.

FIX (str_replace on screen): annotate the channel with a reducer —
``Annotated[list[dict], operator.add]`` — exactly as ``agent_contributions`` and
``routing_history`` do in the real state.

Both graphs below fan two nodes out from START into the same channel; only the annotation
differs.
