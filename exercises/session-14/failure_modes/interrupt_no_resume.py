"""Failure mode #3 — interrupt() pauses, but the resume never continues.

SYMPTOM (live): the graph pauses at the human gate (``status = awaiting_human_review``),
the reviewer approves, the resume call returns 200 — and yet the original run is still
stuck. A second look shows a BRAND NEW run was created and the paused one never moved.

CAUSE: the ``thread_id`` differs between the initial invoke and the resume. A checkpointer
keys state by ``thread_id``; ``Command(resume=...)`` on a different thread does not answer
the pending interrupt on the first thread — it starts a fresh run.

FIX (str_replace on screen): derive the thread id the SAME way in both calls — from the
estimation id: ``{"configurable": {"thread_id": f"s14:{estimation_id}"}}``. That is exactly
what ``src/api/routers/estimate_supervisor.py`` does.

This is a one-node interrupting graph so the mechanics are visible without the rest of the
supervisor.
